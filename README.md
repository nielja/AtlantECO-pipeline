# AtlantECO species distribution modelling pipeline

This modelling pipeline is presented in Knecht et al., (2023, in prep.) and can be used to project global distributions of marine organism abundance or biomass based on observational data. Based on marine organism observations in the format of AtlantECO data and environmental climatologies, five species distribution models (SDMs) are trained and global, monthly projections of biomass or abundance are made. 

The main script detailing the modelling process and guiding through it is general_pipeline.R.
